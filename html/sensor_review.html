          This is a site I found that specializes in example code, something that is very useful to me given a lot of the way I learn is by backwards engineering. It doesn’t give much in the way of tutorial information, but selecting one of these listed sensors displays several pages of example code/links to where that specific sensor is being used. Once I get a better understanding of Android syntax and fundamentals, I feel like this will be a great site to go to for more ideas on putting things to use.</br></br>Rating: 4/5 (Not an immediate help, but something to keep)

          This link gives a basic overview and tutorial for different Android sensors, the specific methods to better utilize them, and a simple step by step project demonstrating it. While I already have a list of sensors in the previous, this link also expands on that by describing the different types (Motion/Environmental/Position + Software/Hardware). My biggest area of interest here is the talk of things like event listeners, delays and general sensor/notification manager use. If I can take some time to follow along and recreate things, I think it’ll help me out a lot when I need to put my project together.</br></br>Rating: 5/5

          This is a site I’ll absolutely be looking into when it comes to creating my projects. The information is a few years old now, but it gives a long list of links covering a swathe of an app’s basic features (buttons, media, communication, etc). It does include some basic sensor details, though my interest here is with most everything else given my lack of experience in the platform. </br></br>Rating: 5/5
